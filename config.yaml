    default: 3
    description: |
      How many nodes to wait for before trying to create the monitor cluster
      this number needs to be odd, and more than three is a waste except for

    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Optional configuration to support use of additional sources such as:

      charm which is NOT provided by the packages in the main Ubuntu archive

      disabled and a non-temporary address must be configured/available on
      your network interface.
